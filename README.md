# 🎭 InsideOutApp  
This project is an API that collects data from a diary about emotions based on the eponymous film. The data is displayed in table form, integrating a CRUD.
The main objective is to practice with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework.

## ⚙️ Installation prerequisites
🟢Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/source-code)

🟢Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## 🛠️ Installation Guide 
1️⃣ First, open a terminal in the folder where you want the repository to be cloned and enter this command:

`git clone https://github.com/Manusitox360/inside-Out-Project.git`

2️⃣ In your preferred environment, open the project you cloned; you will need three consoles for the next step.

▷Console 1:
    `npm install` `npm run dev`
    
▷Console 2:
    `composer install` `php artisan serve`
    
▷Console 3: 
    `php artisan migrat:fresh`
    
3️⃣ In the second console that you have opened, press the ctrl key and click on the link to localhost that it offers you. It should take you to the main view of the project where the journal is located.

⚠️ If you have done the previous steps and the view has not opened correctly, go back to the third command console and enter this:

`php artisan key:generate` `php artisan config:cache` 

## 🌐 Endpoints 
We have generated five endpoints, four for each CRUD function and one extra for the show button.

### ✏️ Create
`pegar aqui endpoint`

### 📖 Read
`pegar aqui endpoint`

### ✏️✏️ Update
`pegar aqui endpoint`

### ❌ Delete
`pegar aqui endpoint`

### 👁️ Show
`pegar aqui endpoint`

## 🧪 Tests 
All tests passed. Introduce this line on your console to check it:

`./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`

*añadir capura de este resultado*


If you want to launch the tests and view them you can put these commands in console 3:

`php artisan test --coverage` `php artisan test --coverage-html=coverage-report`

*añadir comandos para carpeta de resultados de test y captura de los resultados*

## 🗂️ Diagram made (DDBB) 
For the correct structuring of the database, we have carried out this test in [drawSQL](https://drawsql.app) that will serve as a basis for the creation of the future table.
